# hoergrete

HörGrete is the open source sister of HörBert (http://www.hoerbert.com). It is a tactile MP3 player for children built around the touch board from bareconductive (https://www.bareconductive.com). The drawings on the frontpanel are in conductive paint - toch a shape an the musik starts... it's magic!

- 1 stereo audio amplifier
- 2 8 Ohm speakers
- 1 single cell LiPo battery 
- a bunch of wires
- a couple pieces of fabric
- hot glue
- and lots of time and patients

see the "datasheets" folder for more details on the components. All the drawings you need the lasercut your own device are in the "body" folder.

## Software

At this moment in time I'm running the default software of the touch board. it's a simple mp3 player that plays a song when a node is touched. In the nearer future I'm planing to add functionality to the arcade buttons like pause, volume and swapping from music to sounds and back. I'll upload the code here once it's ready.
