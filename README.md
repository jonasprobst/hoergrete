# HörGrete

HörGrete is the open source sister of HörBert (http://www.hoerbert.com). It is a tactile MP3 player for children built around the touch board from bareconductive (https://www.bareconductive.com). The drawings on the front panel are in conductive paint - toche a shape an the music starts... it's magic!

## Software

At this moment in time I'm running the default software of the touch board. it's a simple mp3 player that plays a song when a node is touched. In the nearer future I'm planing to add functionality to the arcade buttons like pause, volume and swapping from music to sounds and back. I'll upload the code here once it's ready.
